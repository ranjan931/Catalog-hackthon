# Shamir's Secret Sharing - Constant Term Calculation

## Overview
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm. The main objective is to decode polynomial roots provided in a JSON format and compute the constant term of the polynomial using Lagrange interpolation.

## Problem Statement
Given a polynomial of degree \( m \) represented as:

\[ f(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + c \]

The task is to find the constant term \( c \) using the roots provided in a specific format. The roots are encoded in different bases, and the goal is to decode these values and use them to find the polynomial coefficients.

## Requirements
- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
